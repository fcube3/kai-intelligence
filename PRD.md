# PRD — Kai Intelligence

## Problem
Feng needs a single-page daily briefing that synthesizes market intelligence for hard assets (gold, silver, crypto) from institutional sources, social signals, and live prices. No fluff, no subscriptions — just signal.

## User
Feng (solo operator, daily consumer).

## Goals
- Deliver actionable daily briefing in <30 seconds of reading
- Live prices always visible
- Archive of past briefings for pattern recognition
- Multi-language for sharing with Chinese/Arabic-speaking contacts

## Non-Goals
- User accounts or multi-tenancy
- Trading execution
- Real-time alerts/notifications (that's OpenClaw's job)

## Success Metrics
- Feng opens it daily
- Briefing is current (same-day data)
- Page loads in <2s on mobile
